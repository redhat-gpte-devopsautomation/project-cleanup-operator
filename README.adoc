= Project Cleanup Operator

== Overview

This repository contains the code to build a Project Cleanup Operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. It will not run on Kubernetes because it uses the `Project` object which is unique to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The Operator will look for a cluster scoped custom resource *ProjectCleanup* that contains the configuration for the operator. The configuration contains the default cleanup period for projects and project name prefixes to ignore.

If the Project creationTimestamp is older than the cleanup period the project is deleted - unless the project name starts with a prefix to be ignored.
